We can describe Artificial Intelligence (AI) as any task performed by a program or a machine. If a
human carried out the same activity, we would say the human had to apply intelligence to accomplish
the task. The natural question that comes to our mind is *what should we aim to do in
AI?*

To answer this question, let us go back to 120 years ago when we were trying to create an ob-
ject(airplane) that can fly like a bird. At that time, we had two choices.

1.  Design objects that look like birds.

2.  Design objects that can fly without necessarily looking like birds.

The initial efforts were towards the first route, but we settled for the second route, and we created
airplanes later in time. Hence, we should aim to design objects that can act rationally, and we call such
objects rational agents.

In this course, we will learn different techniques to design rational agents. Before going into details
of it, first, address *how to determine whether or not these objects(rational agents) are capable of thinking
like human beings*

In 1950, Turing proposed that let humans and AI systems communicate through some medium. If
an AI system can convince a human that he/she is talking to another human, not an AI system, then
we can say that the AI system can think like a human being. This test to determine whether the AI
system can fool humans is commonly known as the Turing test. Nowadays, before logging into many
websites, we have to prove that we are not a robot by answering questions or entering some captcha, is
an example of Turing test.

Now, let us discuss Rational Agent Design (RAD) in detail.

## Rational Agent Design

An agent is an entity that perceives its environment through its
sensors.
Figure <a href="#fig:aisetup" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:aisetup">1</a>[1]
explains the setup, it has an environment sensors for perception, an
*agent function* to map history of precepts to action, and a
actuators to preform the action.

Agent Function:
It is a functions that maps percepts histories/sequences to actions. Let
*P* be the sequence of percepts and *A* be the actions, then
function *f* : *P*<sup>\*</sup> ↦ *A*.

Agent Program:
It run on physical architecture to perform agent function *f*.

Let us try to understand this setting through an example of a mopping robot, and we can call this as
MopBot. Let us say there are two locations *A* and *B*, and the precepts of MopBot allow it to figure out
the location and the state of the location, i.e., whether the location is dirty or clean.

Enivorment
\- The location of MopBot and status of the each location.

Percepts
\- Current location and status of that location.

Actions
\- Left, Right, Clean, Idle.

Let us assume that location A is on left location B. Percept sequence represents \[Location, Status\].

Table <a href="#tab: mopbot" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tab: mopbot">1</a>
represents the action functions for MopBot agent. But, the question
arise here is *what is a rational agent*. Before formally answering this
questions, let us introduce agent function for same MopBot agent. In
Table <a href="#tab: mopbot2" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tab: mopbot2">2</a>,
we can see that there are two set of actions are described for a percept
sequence. Let say agent function *f*<sub>1</sub> maps percepts to
action<sub>1</sub>, and agent function *f*<sub>2</sub> maps percepts to
action<sub>2</sub>.

<th style="text-align: left;">Clean</th>
<th style="text-align: left;">Right</th>

</tbody>
</table>


Now, the question is *What is the difference between a system with agent
function f<sub>1</sub>, and a system with agent function
f<sub>2</sub>. As we can see, with agent function
f<sub>2</sub>, the system is not MopBot. With the agent function
f<sub>2</sub>, the system is not doing the right thing, it is not
behaving rational.

#### Rational Agent

An agent should strive to *do the right thing* based on what it can
perceive, and the actions it can perform. Note that rationality is not
all-knowing with infinite knowledge.

## Task Environment

How to check if an agent is doing the right thing or not; for that, we should have objective criteria
for measuring the success of an agent’s behavior, i.e., we should have a performance measure. For
example, in the case of vacuum-clear agents, we can check the amount of dirt cleaned, time taken to
clean, electricity consumed, noise generated as criteria for measuring performance.

To create a rational agent, we need to specify the task environment. The task environment consists
of the following four things:

-   Performance Measure

-   Environment

-   Actuators

-   Sensors

Let us discuss different properties of task environment.

**Fully observable vs Partially observable**
If sensors provide access to the complete state of the environment at each point in time, it is fully observable; else, it is partially observable.

**Deterministic vs. Stochastic**
If the next state of the environment is completely determined by the current state and the action executed by the agent, it is deterministic, else stochastic.

**Episodic vs. Sequential**
If the choice of current action does not depend on actions in past episodes, it is episodic, else sequential.

**Static vs Dynamic**
If the environment is unchanged while an agent is deliberating, it is static, else it is dynamic.

**Discrete vs. Continuous**
If it has a finite number of distinct states, percepts, and actions, it is discrete, else continuous.

**Single agent vs. Multi-agent**
If an agent is operating by itself in an environment, it is a single agent, else multi-agent.

Properties of task environment largely determine agent design. The world is partially observable,
stochastic, sequential, dynamic, continuous, and multi-agent.

## Agent Function

Let us again visit the definition of agent function: It maps percepts histories/sequences to actions. Let
P be the sequence of percepts and *A* be the actions, then function
*f* : *P*<sup>\*</sup> ↦ *A*.

Suppose we have a table-lookup definition for agent function, i.e., a table where for every percept,
there is action.


<hr style="border:1px solid gray">

**Algorithm 1** <span id="algo:table-drive-agent-function" label="algo:table-drive-agent-function"></span> Table-Driven-Agent(<em>percept</em>)

<hr style="border:1px solid gray">

1. Static: <em> percepts</em>: a sequence, <em> table </em>: a table of actions, indexed by percept sequences, fully specified.
2. percepts $\gets$  percepts <span class="math inline">$\cup$</span> <em>percept</em>
3. action <span class="math inline">$\leftarrow$</span> LOOKUP(<em>percepts,table</em>)
4. Return action

<hr style="border:1px solid gray">

Algorithm <a href="#algo:table-drive-agent-function" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="algo:table-drive-agent-function">1</a>
represents the table driven agent function definition.
Algorithm <a href="#algo:table-drive-agent-function" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="algo:table-drive-agent-function">1</a> has the following drawbacks:

-   Huge table to store.

-   Take a long time to build the table.

-   So many entries to get correct

There are four types of agent functions: Simple Reflex, Model-Based
Reflex, Goal based, Utility based.
Table <a href="#tab:agentprog" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tab:agentprog">3</a>
 shows all four types of agent functions in detail.

The goal-based agent function tries to achieve a respecified goal, and the utility-based agent functions
triers to maximize utility. The performance measure is what others care about, while the utility is what
the agent cares about. Ideally, the two should match, but it is not always the case.
In addition to that, there are two more types of agents

In addition to that, there are two more types of agents.

**Learning agent:**
The agent can learn about the performance/environment measure.

**Autonamous agent:**
An agent can update its agent program based on its experiences.

We will not discuss about Reflex/ Model-Based-Reflex agent, we will start our discussion with goal based agents.
